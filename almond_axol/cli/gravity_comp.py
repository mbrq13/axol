axol gravity-comp

Put the Axol arms into gravity-compensation mode so the operator can move them
by hand. Each free arm joint is sent ``set_impedance(p_des=current, v_des=0,
kp=0, kd=KD, t_ff=gravity)`` at the configured rate; joints not in the free
set are held rigidly at their current position with their configured
``ArmConfig`` gains; the gripper is held softly at its current position.

Every field is reachable from the CLI (draccus-style) or a JSON/YAML file:

    axol gravity-comp
    axol gravity-comp --right_channel null
    axol gravity-comp --kd 1.0
    axol gravity-comp --free_joints [WRIST_3]
    axol gravity-comp --right_channel null --free_joints [SHOULDER_1,WRIST_3]
    axol gravity-comp --config_path my_gravity.json
