"""Self-update for ``axol serve`` installed as a uv tool.

The hosted installer (``curl https://axol.almond.bot/install | bash``) installs
the package with ``uv tool install`` from GitHub and runs ``axol serve`` under
a systemd service with ``Restart=always``. This module keeps that install in
sync with ``main``: whenever the control panel talks to the server, a debounced
background task runs ``uv tool upgrade almond-axol``, and if the installed git
commit changed *and* nothing is running, the process exits so systemd restarts
it on the new code.

Dev checkouts (``uv run axol serve`` from a clone) are untouched: the package
metadata then points at a local directory, not a git URL, and the updater
no-ops.
