class VRTeleopConfig:
    """Configuration for a :class:`VRTeleop` session.

    Attributes:
        rest_pose_left: Left arm rest configuration in radians, shape (7,) in
            ARM_JOINTS order (no gripper). Used as the reset target.
        rest_pose_right: Right arm rest configuration in radians, shape (7,) in
            ARM_JOINTS order (no gripper). Used as the reset target.
        frequency: Control loop rate in Hz used by :meth:`VRTeleop.run` and
            as waypoint density for reset trajectories.
        reset_speed: Average joint velocity (rad/s) of the worst-case joint
            during a return-to-rest move. The smoothstep profile gives a
            peak joint velocity of ``1.5 * reset_speed``. Determines the
            number of trajectory waypoints based on the distance to the
            rest pose, subject to ``reset_min_duration`` below.
        reset_min_duration: Floor (seconds) on the return-to-rest trajectory
            duration. Prevents near-rest starts from snapping home in a
            handful of frames and gives every reset a consistent minimum
            feel regardless of starting pose. Defaults to ``1.5`` s.
        reset_rest_weight: Cost weight penalising deviation from the reset
            target pose during collision-aware trajectory generation.
        reset_limit_weight: Cost weight penalising joint-limit violations
            during reset trajectory generation.
        reset_collision_margin: Minimum clearance (m) enforced between
            collision bodies during reset trajectory generation.
        reset_collision_weight: Cost weight on self-collision penalty during
            reset trajectory generation.
        reset_max_iterations: Maximum solver iterations per reset waypoint.
        engage_max_vel: Maximum joint velocity (rad/s) used by the
            trapezoidal filter when teleop is first engaged after a
            rest-pose trajectory (startup or reset).  Slows the transition from
            rest pose to the first IK target.  Restored to ``teleop_max_vel``
            after ``engage_duration`` seconds.  Defaults to
            ``reset_speed`` for a consistent feel.
        engage_duration: Seconds to hold ``engage_max_vel`` after the
            post-rest engage rising edge before restoring ``teleop_max_vel``.
        teleop_max_vel: Maximum joint velocity (rad/s) enforced by the
            trapezoidal filter during normal teleoperation.  Limits how fast
            any single joint can move toward a new IK target.  Defaults to
            0.5 rev/s (~180 °/s).
        teleop_max_accel: Maximum joint acceleration (rad/s²) enforced by the
            trapezoidal filter.  Controls how quickly the commanded velocity
            ramps up or down.  Defaults to 1.5 rev/s² (~540 °/s²), giving a
            ~0.2 s ramp from rest to full speed.
        ik_alpha: Blend factor for the exponential moving average applied to
            the IK output before the trapezoidal filter.  Range ``(0, 1]``
            where ``1.0`` disables smoothing.  Lower values kill more
            high-frequency jitter at the cost of a small fixed lag
            (``~(1-alpha)/alpha`` frames).  Defaults to ``0.7`` (~3 ms lag
            at 120 Hz), which removes most IK noise without a perceptible
            feel difference.
        pose_min_cutoff: Minimum cutoff frequency (Hz) for the One Euro Filter
            applied to raw VR controller positions, quaternions, and elbow
            positions **before** they enter the IK solver.  This is the
            primary tremor / tracking-noise kill knob.  Lower values give
            heavier smoothing at rest (more tremor rejection) at the cost of
            slightly more lag when still.  Typical range: 0.5–3 Hz.  Defaults
            to ``1.5`` Hz.
        pose_beta: Speed coefficient for the One Euro Filter.  Raises the
            filter cutoff proportionally to the signal's instantaneous speed,
            keeping the filter transparent during fast intentional moves.  For
            meter-space positions at 120 Hz a value of ~20 works well; increase
            if fast moves feel sticky.  Defaults to ``20.0``.
        position_multiplier: Scale factor applied to the controller's
            **position** displacement (not orientation) when mapping hand
            motion to the end-effector target.  ``1.0`` is 1:1 motion;
            ``2.0`` moves the arm twice as far as the hand, which helps cover
            the robot's full reach when the arm is longer than the operator's.
            Applied to both the end-effector and elbow position deltas so the
            arm posture scales coherently.  Defaults to ``1.0``.
        rotation_multiplier: Scale factor applied to the controller's
            **orientation** displacement (not position) when mapping hand
            motion to the end-effector target.  The relative rotation of the
            controller since engage is converted to axis-angle and its angle
            is scaled by this factor; ``1.0`` is 1:1 motion, ``2.0`` rotates
            the end-effector twice as far as the wrist.  Defaults to ``1.0``.
