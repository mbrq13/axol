"""
WebRTC video relay for streaming wrist cameras to the VR headset.

During data collection the upper computer already decodes the left_arm and
right_arm ZED streams to RGB numpy frames (see ``ZedCamera``). This module
re-encodes those frames as a low-latency WebRTC stream that the Quest WebXR app
can render directly, so the teleoperator can see the grippers.

The existing VR WebSocket (``/ws``) is reused purely for SDP signaling — no new
ports. aiortc gathers ICE candidates during ``setLocalDescription`` and embeds
them in the SDP (non-trickle), so on a LAN no separate candidate exchange is
needed.

aiortc is an optional dependency (the ``video`` extra); importing this module
requires it.
